#Personal Finances

This was the final challenge proposed to students in the Initial C# course. This course was taught by me, online and free.

The objective of this challenge was to consolidate the concepts studied so far in the fundamentals of the C# language, structuring a Console Application that provided basic control of personal finances.

The challenge was divided into 3 parts:

Part 01 - Implementation of revenue management (code found in this repository);

Part 02 - Implementation of expense management.
Part 03- Implementation of the Statement.

Students were challenged to implement the logic for parts 02 and 03.

In this challenge we explore the concepts of:

Conditional Structures;
Repetition Structures;
Data conversions;
Lists;
Classes and methods
